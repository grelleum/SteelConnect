Getting Help with SteelConneciton:
----------------------------

| For help with SteelConneciton (this Python package) open an issue
  on the project home page.
| https://github.com/grelleum/SteelConnection

If you decide to post an issue, please keep the following in mind:

- Errors are meaningless without the code that produced those errors.
- If your code does not produce the result you expect, let me know
  what results you expected.
- | Please wrap your code in triple-backtics so that all indentation
    will be preserved.
  | https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Here is how code and errors should be posted when opening an issue on GitHub:

.. code::

   ```
   for this in that:
       print('triple backticks makes your code...')
       print('...look the same as it does in your editor!')
   ```
