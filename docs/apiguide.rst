API Guide
=========

Realms and Organizations
------------------------

There is a one to one relationship between a Realm and a SteelConnect CX
Manager. The SteelConnect CX Manager acts as the controller for a the
realm. A newly created realm would not have any organizations, otherwise
a realm will have one or more organizations. Each oganization within a
realm acts an autonomous network system. In practice, most REST API
operations are performed within a specific organization.

| You normally access the SteelConnect CX Manager (SCM) using a web
  browser.
| The URL you use includes the realm and organization that you are
  managing and takes the form:
  ``https://realm.riverbed.cc/admin/Organization``.
| The Organization is case-sensistive and is also known as the
  organization short name, as opposed to the longname, which is more
  descriptive and can include spaces, and other characters.

Understanding the API
---------------------

The Riverbed SteelConnect CX REST API allows HTTPS access to the
SteelConnect CX Manager (SCM) via the use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
commands. SteelConneciton (this module) acts to simplify coding by
providing an object that remembers your realm, version, and
authentication and builds the HTTPS requests based on that information.
A ``requests.session`` object is used to allow a single TCP connection
to be re-used for all subsequent API requests.

Available Methods
-----------------

| SteelConneciton provides the ``.get``, ``.getstatus``, ``.post``,
  ``.put``, and ``.delete`` methods to simplify access to the API.
| These methods will build the request to include api version, auth,
  etc, so you onlu need to specify the resource you are interrested in.

-  get: Used for retrieving information about a resource. Expect data to
   be returned.
-  getstatus: Used for retrieving current status about a resource.
   Expect data to be returned.
-  post: Create or deploy a new resource. Requires additional data in
   the payload and returns the newly created object.
-  put: Use to edit or update some existing resource. Requires
   additional data in the payload.
-  delete: Delete an existing resource.

A Tale of Two APIs
------------------

| Riverbed divides the REST API into two APIs: \* Config: used to make
  configurations changes and get information about SteelConnect CX
  resources.
| https://support.riverbed.com/apis/scm_beta/scm-2.11.1/scm.config/index.html
  \* Reporting: used to get current status information about a resource.
| https://support.riverbed.com/apis/scm_beta/scm-2.11.1/scm.reporting/index.html

By nature, the Reporting API only requires the HTTP GET method, where-as
the more commonly used Confg API requires GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
SteelConnections combines the two APIs by implementing ``.get``,
``.post``, ``.put``, and ``.delete`` methods to access to Config API and
the ``.getstatus`` method to access the Reporting API.

For example: Calling ``.get('/port/' + port)`` would retireve
configuration settings on a port, where-as
``.getstatus('/port/' + port)`` would retreive the actual link state,
speed, duplex, etc. for that port.

Crafting your API calls
-----------------------

| The Riverbed documentation describes the various REST API calls that
  can be made.
| These take the form: “*HTTP Method*” “*resource path*”.

| Take the network section for example:
| https://support.riverbed.com/apis/scm_beta/scm-2.11.1/scm.config/index.html#!/network:

- ``GET /networks`` List networks.
- ``GET /org/:orgid/networks`` Get network for an org.
- ``POST /org/:orgid/networks`` Create network within an org.
- ``DELETE /networks/:netid`` Delete network.
- ``GET /networks/:netid`` Get network.
- ``PUT /networks/:netid`` Update a network.

Within the resource path, you may see a name preceded by a colon ``:``.
These are considered variables and must be replaced with an actual
value. The ``/networks/:netid`` would require the ``:netid`` be replaced
with the actual network ID for the network you are requesting.

| SteelConnection methods mimic the HTTP Methods and accept the short
  form resource paths.
| To update a network, the documentation lists ``PUT``
  ``/networks/:netid``. With the SteelConnection object, you would call
  the put method as ``sc.put('/network/' +  net_id)``. Note that the
  leading ``/`` in the resource is optional as the SteelConnection
  object will insert it if it is missing.

Model Schema (Data Payload):
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Post (create) and Put (update) requests require additional data in the
form of a payload. This gets sent to the server in the form of JSON
data, however the SteelConnection object will accept either JSON data or
a native Python dictionary (``isinstance(data, dict)``). The Riverbed
documentation will specify the format of the data as a “Model Schema”.
Not everything listed in the model schema is required. Generally, you
can determine the minimum required data by checking the equivalent
function in SteelConnect CX Manager web GUI.


Retrieving Data
---------------

The SteelConnection methods leverage the popular requests package.
Methods calls always return a native Python dictionary, or a list of
dictionaries, depending on the API call. The ``requests.response``
object will be stored as an attribute of the object (``sc.response``) so
the latest response is always easily accessible. By providing the full
``requests.response`` object you are free to check status and see all
headers.

| For example, the ‘get orgs’ request should always provide a list of
  orgs within the realm, so we can directly assign the result as a
  native Python list.
| ``list_of_all_orgs = sc.get('orgs')``

Here are the rules to determine what gets returned by an API request:

- If response.json() is True and the ‘items’ key exists, then return a
  python list of response.json()[‘items’].
- If response.json() is True and the ‘items’ key *does not* exist,
  then return a python dictionary.
- If response.json() is False, return an empty python dictionary.
